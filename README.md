# House-Price-Prediction
Building a Linear Regression Model which can predict the House Prices accurately.
# Abstract
The Residential Property Price Prediction project aims to accurately forecast the market prices of residential properties using historical sales data. By leveraging a variety of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, this project identifies key property features that most significantly influence price fluctuations. The dataset, sourced from a real estate platform over a span of three years, encapsulates diverse property types across multiple geographic locations.

# Introduction
Predicting residential property prices accurately is crucial for both real estate investors and home buyers to make informed decisions. This project delves into predictive analytics to model property prices based on historical data, considering factors such as property size, location, and amenities. Property price prediction is complicated by the non-linear relationships between price and features, rapidly changing market conditions, and regional economic factors.

# Proposed Methods
This project employs the following machine learning algorithms to tackle the prediction task:
Linear Regression: To establish a baseline for prediction accuracy using continuous variable relationships.
Random Forest: For capturing non-linear dependencies through an ensemble of decision trees.
Gradient Boosting: To enhance prediction performance by correcting previous models' errors in a sequential improvement manner.
Code
The code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction is organized within a Jupyter Notebook, providing a step-by-step guide through the machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning to model validation.

# Result
The project's outcomes include detailed performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score for each model. Comparative analysis demonstrates the efficacy of ensemble methods over simple linear models in handling complex, real-world data distributions.

# Conclusion
The Residential Property Price Prediction project underscores the potency of machine learning techniques in the real estate domain. It concludes that advanced ensemble methods, particularly Gradient Boosting, provide superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional regression approaches. The findings advocate for the integration of machine learning into real estate market analysis tools to support dynamic pricing strategies and investment decisions.
